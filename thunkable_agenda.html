        <h2>Written Response</h2>

        <br>

        <h3>I. Describe the overall purpose of the program.</h3>

        <p>
            The program’s purpose is to store and organize the user’s assignments, their due dates, grades, and to calculate Grade Point Average, as well as store all of this information.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>II. Describe what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video.</h3>

        <p>
            In the video, the program is shown accessing and closing lists of high school assignments organized by subject, as well as creating lists and adding and deleting items from said lists. It calculates the user's Grade Point Average from the grades they input for each period. The Program is also shown locally storing the user's grades and Grade Point Average, and retrieving said information from local storage. 
        </p>
        
        <br>

        <h3>III. Describe the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.</h3>

        <p>
            After initializing, the app navigates to Selection Screen, which has multiple points for user input, with varied outputs. When the list grid item labeled "Chemistry" was clicked, the app navigated to a screen which displays assignments in a list viewer. When an item in said list viewer was clicked, a popup screen appears, asking the user whether they'd like to delete the item they clicked. If the user hits the "confirm" button, the item is deleted from the list viewer. The "Cancel" button at the top of the screen is then clicked, which navigates the user back to the menu screen. 
        </p>
  
        <p>
            On said menu screen, the button labeled "Add Class" is then clicked, which navigates to a screen which calls for a text input. Once that text input has been entered (in this case "Computer Science"), the confirm button is clicked, which adds a list item to the item grid on the Selection Screen named for what the user typed, and the user is then navigated back to the Selection Screen, where their newly created list item can be seen. Then the newly created list item is clicked, navigating to a new assignment list screen dedicated to Computer Science. On said page, the user then clicks the "+" button. The "+" button navigates the user to a screen that collects user input describing an assignment. On this screen the user inputs text naming the assignment's title, due date, and subject. Once the information has been entered, the Confirm button is pressed, which creates a new row in the Computer Science assignment list containing the text information entered, and then navigates back to the Computer Science screen, where the newly created assignment can be viewed. The user then hits the Cancel button at the top-right of the Computer Science assigment screen. This navigates them back to the Selection Screen.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the Selection Screen, the user clicks the button labeled "About". This navigates them to the About Section of the App. On this screen,there are a few sentences concerning the app that can be read. The user then clicks the Cancel button at the top-left of the screen, which navigates back to the Selection Screen. 
        </p>

        <p>
            From the Selection Screen once again, the user clicks the "Grades" button. This navigates the user to the Grades screen. There are already 5 grades that have been previously input on the screen. On the Grades screen, the user clicks the "Add a Class" button, which navigates to another screen, containing 2 text input bars and one slider. In the 1st and 2nd text bars, the user input the the Percent score of their 6th period class and the letter score, respectively. The slider on the grade input screen contained 3 options: CP, HP, and AP, signifying the 3 class types in a typical high school: College Prep, Honors Placement, and Advanced Placement. The user selected HP on the slider. Then, the user clicked the "confirm" button at the bottom of the screen, which created a list item on the Grades Screen displaying all of the information entered. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On the Grades Screen, the user then clicked the "Calculate GPA" button. This button took the percent scores from all 6 classes that had been entered, and assigned each of them a number between 0.0 and 4.0 on the GPA scale. It then found the average of the 6 GPA scores, which in this case was 4.0, and set the text of the label at the center of the screen to display that result.
        </p>

        <p>
            From there, the user clicked the "Save GPA" button at the bottom of the screen. This button opened an alert box asking the user to confirm that they want to save their GPA score and period grades to Local Storage. The user hits the "confirm" button, which closes the alert and saves all of the grade information and the GPA score from the Grades Screen to Local Storage. To test that the save was successful, the user hits the "Clear Grades" button, causing another popup to appear, which upon confirmation deletes all of the list items in the Grades List and resets the GPA score to 0.0. The user then clicked the "Load Grades" button, which calls another alert to show, asking the user to confirm their intention to replace whatever information is already on-screen with the information being stored locally. When confirmed, the alert closes, and the information that was saved (the GPA and Grade List items) is entered on-screen again. 
        </p>
